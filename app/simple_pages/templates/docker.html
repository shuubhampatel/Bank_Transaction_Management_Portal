        <h4>Lets read about Docker</h4>
        <div class="col-8">
            <p>Docker is an open-source platform for building, deploying, and managing containerized apps. It enables
                programmers to bundle applications into containers, which are standardized executable components that
                integrate application source code with OS libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any
                environment. Basically, it solves the common and most important problem called <b>"This application
                    Works on My Computer but Not Theirs."</b></p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>containers: </b>a container is a running instance of an image, so by using that, we can run our
                    image on any system and server. And it also automates the configuration and deployment of a given
                    application very easily. So containers make deploying distributed apps easier, and they're becoming
                    more popular as companies move to cloud-native development and hybrid multi-cloud setups.Â 
                </li>
                <li><b>Images: </b>images are nothing more than layers of software that are layered on top of each
                    other. For example, in one layer is Ubuntu, and we have application code in the above layer, so this
                    whole thing is combined into a layer that composes our final image that we use to deploy and create
                    containers from it.
                </li>
                <li><b>Docker Hub:</b>The Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository in which Docker users and partners can
                    create, test, store, and distribute container images. A user can use Docker Hub to access public,
                    open-source image repositories as well as create their own private repositories.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Docker Commands:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><b>docker images </b> : it will give total list of images in your system</li>
                <li><b>docker ps </b>: it will Give total number of running containers in your system</li>
                <li><b>docker stop containerID</b>: it will stop container of given containerID</li>
                <li><b>docker rm [containerID]</b>: This command is used to delete a stopped container</li>
                <li><b>docker pull [imageName/ repoPath] </b>:it will pull an image or repository from registry
                </li>
                <li><b>docker build -t docker_username/repo_name: tag . </b>: it will build docker image (below I
                    explained in detail)
                </li>
                <li><b>docker run -dp PORT:PORT docker_username/repo_name: tag </b>: it will run you builded image on
                    given port
                </li>
                <li><b>docker push docker_username/repo_name: tag </b>: it will push image to given docker repo.</li>
                <li><b> docker commit</b>: it will use to commit file changes into new image.</li>
                <li><b> docker system prune -a </b>: Remove all unused containers, networks, images (both dangling and
                    unreferenced), and optionally, volumes.
                </li>
                <li><b>docker login </b>: login to docker cloud
                </li>
            </ul>
            </br>
            <h5>How to Start the Project:</h5>
            <p>To start the project, we have to create a file called Dockerfile (explanation is below how to and what to
                include in this file), a Docker compose file, and requirement files to add package layer in our image in
                the root directory and then we have run the docker file by command <b> docker-compose</b> up to check
                and verify
                our image work locally on localhost and if everything looks good then we can create one repo to docker
                hub and we can build image to push it docker hub to do so following are the command.<br><br>To build
                image
                we can type this command <b>docker build -t docker_username/repo_name: tag . (Note there is a (dot) at
                    the end </b>
                Because it tells that docker should look for the docker file in current directory.)
                now your docker image is build and ready to push it to your docker hub repo.
                before pushing do<b> docker run -dp 80:5000 docker_username/repo_name: tag </b>run that just built image
                so
                after that it will show your app in localhost:5000 because in docker file you mentioned 5000 port as
                host and port 80 for docker container.Now you can push it to docker hub by following command:<br>
                <b>docker push docker_username/repo_name: tag</b><br><br>
                Now if your image is pushed in public repo then anyone can pull it and if you want to modify then do it
                and apply docker commit
                command and follow the same steps to push changed image to docker hub and give new tag to image before
                pushing it.
            </p>
            </br>

            <h5>About dockerfile:</h5>
            <p>Dockerfile is a simple text file that consists of instructions to build Docker images.The specific
                commands you can use in a dockerfile are:
            <ul>
                - FROM - Creates a layer from the ubuntu:18.04<br>
                - PULL - Adds files from your Docker repository<br>
                - RUN - Builds your container<br>
                - CMD - Specifies what command to run within the container<br>
            </ul>
            <p>Mentioned below is an example of the dockerfile with the important commands:</p>
            <p> FROM ubuntu:18.04<br>
                PULL. /file<br>
                RUN make /file<br>
                CMD python /file/file.py<br>
            </p>
