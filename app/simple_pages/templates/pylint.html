        <h4>Lets read about Pylint</h4>
        <div class="col-8">
            <p>Pylint is a static code analysis tool written in Python for the purpose of analysis. It may check for
                programming flaws, implement coding standards best practices, discover code violations, and advise
                reworking. It is totally customisable by the user and has built-in specific routines for controlling
                particular errors and alarms within the user's code.</p>
            <p> to install pylint on windows or mac machine according to documentation you should write<br> <code>pip
                install pylint</code></p>
            <p>Pylint will display a number of messages as it analyzes the code and it can also be used for displaying
                some statistics about the number of warnings and errors found in different files. The messages are
                classified under various categories such as errors and warnings.

            </p>
            <p>As you can see in image1 that shows that in this application i have made test for every page including
                operations by doing that i can make sure that my page is currently opening and there will be no issue
                after deploying to development and here you can see after starting session it gives testfile path pytest
                and pylint version as summery here need of operation test to make sure that defined
                calculator methods are giving proper answer or not. in the image2 you can see that here if i
                divide by zero then it will generate an error message otherwise it will pass the test.<br> here you can
                see in image3 that in the divide operation test i have checked both conditions one as normal condition
                and second one as a divide by zero to check our functions are working properly or not while giving any
                numbers. </p>


            <h4>Following are the General definitions:</h4>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li><h5>OOP terms with definitions:</h5>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) uses "objects" to model
                    realworld objects. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) consist of following some important concepts
                    referred to as the OOPS concepts.<a href=/oops>Please click here to learn this terms by
                        Calculator Program examples</a><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Encapsulation</b>:Wrapping up of a data and functions into single unit is known as
                            encapsulation.
                        </li>
                        <br>

                        <li><b>Inheritance</b>: Inheritance is the process/ Mechanism, by which class can acquire the
                            properties and methods of another class. in simple words deriving a new class from an old
                            class is called inheritance.
                        </li>
                        <br>

                        <li><b>Polymorphism</b>: Polymorphism allows a single name to be used for more than one related
                            purpose.The concept of polymorphism is characterized by the idea of 'one interface, multiple
                            methods'.
                        </li>
                        <br>

                        <li><b>Abstraction</b>: Abstraction is a concept in object-oriented programming that "shows"
                            just the most important features while "hiding" the others. The basic goal of abstraction is
                            to keep people aside from unneeded elements.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><h5>Instantiation:</h5> Object creation in Python is a two-step process. first step is creating
                    objects and second is initialization the object. Python uses <code>__new__</code> method for object
                    creation and <code>__init__</code> for initialization.<br> During the object instantiation process
                    if the class does not define these methods, they are inherited from the <code>object</code>base
                    class.
                </li>
                <li><h5>Object:</h5>An object is an instance of a class.An object is a component of a program that knows
                    how to interact with other pieces of the program.
                </li>
                <li><h5>Class:</h5>A class is a template that specifies the attributes and behavior of things or
                    objects.A class is a prototype from which objects are created. It defines attributes and methods.
                </li>
                <li><h5>Namespace:</h5> It defines a scope for the identifiers that are used in a program. in other
                    words we can think of a namespace as a dictionary in which the keys are the object names and the
                    values are the objects themselves. Each key-value pair maps a name to its corresponding object.
                </li>
                <li><h5>Constructor:</h5> Constructors are generally used for instantiating an object. The task of
                    constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the
                    class is created. in python <code style="color: black">__init__()</code> method is called the
                    constructor. <br>Syntax of
                    constructor declaration :<br><code style="color: black">def __init__(self): <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#
                        body of the constructor</code></li>
                <li><h5>Fixture:</h5> Fixtures are functions, which will run before each test function to which it is
                    applied. Fixtures are used to feed some data to the tests such as database connections, URLs to test
                    and some sort of input data. But Point to note is fixture only works with one test file but if you
                    want to use that fixture in another test file. To make a fixture available to multiple test files,
                    we have to define the fixture function in a file called <b><code
                            style="color: black">conftest.py.</code></b>
                </li>
                <li><h5>Type hint:</h5> Python is a dynamically typed language, which means you never have to explicitly
                    indicate what kind of types variable has. But in some cases, dynamic typing can lead to some bugs
                    that are very difficult to debug and in those cases, Type Hints will useful. <br><code
                            style="color: black">def greeting(name: str) -> str: <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 'Hello ' + name</code><br> in above code you can see
                    that greeting method will take variable as string and <code>--> str</code> shows it also return as
                    string.
                </li>
                <li><h5>Type cast:</h5> Python defines type conversion functions to directly convert one data type to
                    another which is useful in day-to-day and competitive programming.There are two types of Type
                    Conversion in Python:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Implicit Type Conversion</li>
                        <li>Explicit Type Conversion</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><h5>Unit test:</h5> Check that your code is working as expected by creating and running unit tests.
                    It's called unit testing because you break down the functionality of your program into discrete
                    testable behaviors that you can test as individual units.
                </li>
                <li><h5>Static:</h5> Static means, that the member is on a class level rather on the instance level.
                    change in a static variable in one instance of the class, the change will affect its value in all
                    other instances.
                </li>
                <li><h5>Instance method:</h5> Used to access or modify the object state. If we use instance variables
                    inside a method, such methods are called instance methods.
                </li>
                <li><h5>Static method:</h5> A static method is also a method that is bound to the class and not the
                    object of the class. A static method canâ€™t access or modify the class state.
                </li>
                <li><h5>Static property:</h5> "Static" properties and methods belong to a class, rather than to an
                    instance of a class, that means they are shared, in a sense, across the entire project.
                </li>
                <li><h5>Overview of SOLID:</h5> SOLID principles
                    SOLID is an acronym that stands for five object-oriented design principles that help you
                    make the software more understandable, easier to maintain, and easier to extend.<a href=/solid>Please

                    </ul>

                </li>
                <li><h5>Design Patterns:</h5> Design patterns are common solutions to challenging issues in
                    software development. They're similar to pre-made blueprints that we can use to fix a repeated
                    design
                    issue in the code.<br>It have many benefits that overcome problem in software design. it defines a
                    common langauge that helps team to communicate more efficiently.<br>
                    Patterns are classified in 3 groups by their intent.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Creational patterns</li>
                        <li>Structural patterns</li>
                        <li>Behavioral patterns</li>
